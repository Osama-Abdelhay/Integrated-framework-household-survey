The Goal of the analysis workshop is to review of data patterns in order to collect qualitative interpretations. This workshop should stimulate discussions from each presentation. input provided and any decisions taken about changes or additions to the analysis presented should be cautiously recorded.

## Data Disgest Presentation 

Data Anlysis Workshop are among [common good practices](http://jet.jips.org/documents/download/terms-of-reference-for-a-workshop-on-collaborative-analysis-of-the-profiling-findings).
.

*  Engage with various levels (Field, Sector, Partner, Authority..)
*  Facilitation around “data digest” (±60 slides for 3 hours session) 
*  Rapporteur to capture (extensive note taking):

## Faciliation & Note taking

 * __Reflect__: ![](images/reflect.png)  
 
Data quality and or suggestions to change questions

 * __Interpret__:  ![](images/interpret.png)  
 
Qualitative interpretations of data patterns 
 
 * __Recommend__: ![](images/recommend.png)  
 
Programmatic adjustment (3RP or COP design)

 * __Classify__:  ![](images/classify.png)  
 
Level of sensitivity for the information

## Styling guide

### Confidence intervals:

 * Different software often calculate confidence intervals as being negative and hence below zero or above 100. Negative confidence intervals or CI above 100 are meaningless. In the report, always round negative confidence intervals to ‘0’ and round those above 100 to ‘100’.

 
### Rounding decimal points:

 * Make sure to round properly decimal points according to basic rules:
 *  When decimal is between 1-4, round down.
 *  When decimal is between 5-9, round up.

### Decimal points in the results:

 * When the results is a whole number e.g. 30%, make sure to always write 30.0% with the ‘.0’ in the decimal place in the report. This ensures that the decimal point was not forgotten and is actually equal to zero.

### Missing data or consent not provided:

 * Data should be excluded from all analysis and should not be accounted for in the denominator.


### Always clean the data first before going into analysis:

 * Frequencies and means should be run on categorical and continuous variables, respectively.
 * Missing data should be looked at and a record of them should be kept.

### Age variable:

 * When selecting age or creating an age variable category in Epi info software from the ‘months’ variable generated by ENA, don’t forget the ‘.99’ otherwise some children with an exact birth date may be excluded from the analysis. E.g. 6-23.99 (and not 6-23 or 6-23.9).

### Reproducible Analysis

Always save newly generated variables into a new data file named following a naming convention to be respected by all involved in the survey data analysis.
